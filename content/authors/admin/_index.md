A civil engineer from the Philippines, I studied at Columban College. During my studies, I was constantly representing our school at different national quiz shows and I was a finalist in most of them - I placed 3rd overall in the PICEÂ National Quiz Bee 2013. After graduating, I prepared really hard for the board exam. I passed the board exam in May 2015 and placed 7th overall.

After becoming a licensed civil engineer, I had a short stint at structural engineering at a refutable design firm designing buildings, water towers, communication towers, and even bridges.

Now I'm a full time instructor at our local college - because I want to teach you know. So here I am making courses during my free time - and most of the content is FREE.
